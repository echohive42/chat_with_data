# chat_with_data

# This app starts with the AI wikipedia article from data folder and you can chat about it.  
You can add additional documents with the file uploader.  
App will also give gpt powered related topic suggestions to be downloaded fom wikipedia to talk about.  
You have to Vectorize when you add additonal wikipedia articles.   
   
I have modified the promppt so it returns 3 suggested topics from the context and the conversation
